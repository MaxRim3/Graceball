Quick help: how to use this asset?
----------------------------------

Trails FX is an asset for drawing fast and smooth trails behind moving objects.
Just add "Trail Effect" script to any gameobject and configure its properties.

Note: in URP, Space Distortion effect requires Opaque Texture enabled in Universal Rendering Pipeline asset.


Scripting Support
-----------------

Trails FX is designed to be easy to use with the inspector.
If you need to add or change certain values at runtime you can use this code:

TrailsFX.TrailEffect trail = myGameObject.GetComponent<TrailsFX.TrailEffect>();
trail.Clear() : clears any existing trail
trail.xxxx = value; (you can change any property shown in the inspector). Check out the TrailEffect code for a list of properties.
trail.UpdateMaterialProperties() : refresh material settings (call this after changing any property using code)


Hints
-----

If target is moved using physics methods (eg. AddForce) and trails are not smooth enough, enable Rigidbody interpolation setting.
Also make sure physics methods are used in FixedUpdate().



Support & Feedback
------------------

Every property in the inspector shows a tooltip with some info when you pass the mouse over them.
